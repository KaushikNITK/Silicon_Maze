To deploy a chat bot we need a API key of openai or gemini or any other. we went with gemini 

As we apply for a gemini ai's API code of 1.5 pro we can get it free with upto 60 queries per min
The file chatbot.ipynb has details of model and response of the model 

we weren't able to connect and make a domain as were had no sufficient time for that.

main.py has the base code for deplyoing it using flask
